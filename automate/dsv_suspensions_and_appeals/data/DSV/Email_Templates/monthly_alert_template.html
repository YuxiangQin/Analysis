            Hello $Vendor_Name,

            </a> for the month of $month_year ($Chargebacks).
            <br><br>
            Our intent is to protect the Walmart.com customer experience and we also want to ensure your Walmart DSV operations run as smoothly as possible.

            <p>
              It is your responsibility to address and improve the issue(s) causing poor performance.<br>
We regularly review OTD metrics and suppliers that consistently fail to meet performance standards and will have their DSV account under review in partnership with their Walmart Merchant.
            </p>
            <p>
            It is Walmartâ€™s mission to provide you with the tools you need to improve your performance and succeed on the Walmart platform!

            </p>
            <p>
              Here are some to get you started:
              <ul>
                <li>If your rejection rate is high, you may need to analyze your inventory feed. You must submit accurate inventory feeds to avoid receiving orders for items that are out of stock.</li>
                <li>If on-time shipping is an issue, please review the article <a href='https://supplierhelp.walmart.com/s/guide?article=000008343'>Operational Expectations - On Time Delivery</a>.  Every order you receive is assigned an Expected Ship Date (ESD) and you are required to ship orders by the ESD.</li>
